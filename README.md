# II4031 - Cryptography and Coding

## Description

Project Overview

This project entails the development of a comprehensive website utilizing the NEXT.JS framework, TypeScript language, and Tailwind CSS framework. The website serves as a platform to create a dynamic and interactive website for learning and practicing various cryptography and coding techniques.

**Technical Stack**

- **Front End :**
  - NEXT.JS
- **Deployment Platforms :**
  - Vercel (Front End)
- **CSS**
  - Taiwind CSS

## Cryptography Page

The cryptography page will have three subpages, each for a different cryptography and coding task.

### Task 1

The first task is for cipher classic that will present six kinds of cipher classic. They are

- **Vigenere Cipher :** A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.
- **Extended Vigenere Cipher :** A variant of Vigenere cipher that can encrypt any ASCII character from 0 to 255, including image files, video files, and any other files.
- **Playfair Cipher :** A technique of symmetric encryption that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters to substitute pairs of letters in the plaintext.
- **Product Cipher :** A combination of Vigenere Cipher and transposition to achieve a more secure encryption.
- **Affine Cipher :** A type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a mathematical function to map each letter to another letter in the alphabet.
- **Autokey Vigenere Cipher :** A variant of Vigenere cipher that uses the plaintext itself as part of the key.

### Task 2

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development

First of all you need to clone this project or **download the file**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimothySubekti0322/II4031-Kriptografi-Koding
```

Firstly, go to the project folder, and open the folder on your favourite IDE. Then, install all the dependencies by simply run this code on the terminal

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the development server using this command in terminal

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Now you can access **http://localhost:3000**
